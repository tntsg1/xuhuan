# Pixel Observatory Changelog

This is the English-first release log for Pixel Observatory. It restores the
major project history that was previously summarized too aggressively in the
README. Earlier records remain preserved in [`VERSION_HISTORY.md`](VERSION_HISTORY.md),
which contains the detailed target/function/fix/verification format. This file
adds a readable release-facing timeline with dates, player-facing meaning and
concrete implementation details.

## How To Read This Log

- The early `v0.x` and `v1.x` labels are historical development milestones.
- A milestone can describe a system that was later refined; it does not mean
  that every later visual or content issue disappeared permanently.
- Advanced telescope families are described as framework, active development or
  finished only where that distinction is explicit.
- The public Web build is updated only after source changes are exported and
  deployed by the workflow.

## Historical Milestones

### v0.1 — Project Replacement and MVP Foundation

**Purpose:** Replace the former prototype with a 2D pixel astronomy teaching
game and establish a runnable loop.

**Delivered:** The project became Pixel Observatory with a Main Menu, Observatory
Room, Telescope Assembly, Sky Observation, Telescope View, Learning Card and
Learning Journal. Core managers were established for saves, missions, assembly,
telescope math and observation evaluation. Levels, parts, celestial objects and
localization moved into JSON data.

**Why it mattered:** The project stopped being a generic technical prototype and
became a playable astronomy-learning product with a clear educational subject.

### v0.2 — Movable Observatory Room

**Purpose:** Turn the flow into an explorable base instead of a page of buttons.

**Delivered:** A movable player, WASD/arrow movement, proximity interaction,
Mission Board, Parts Cabinet, Assembly Table, Observatory Door, Telescope Pad,
Learning Journal and Stats Terminal. The HUD began showing level, credits,
telescope state and nearby interaction guidance.

**Known lesson:** Early workshop/furniture assets were visually inconsistent,
which motivated the later complete-background approach.

### v0.3 — Observatory Interior Redesign

**Purpose:** Establish a believable astronomy-club room and clearer routes.

**Delivered:** The base was redesigned around a school astronomy club, with a
door and observation pad as meaningful destinations. Missing telescope parts
directed the player to the Assembly Table; a completed telescope directed the
player toward observation.

**Player effect:** The base became part of the story and not just a decorative
background.

### v0.4 — Playable Telescope Assembly

**Purpose:** Replace debug-style installation with a readable assembly activity.

**Delivered:** The three-column Parts Tray / Blueprint / Inspector layout,
select-part-then-snap-slot interaction, installation order, wrong-slot feedback,
wrong-attempt tracking and Finish Assembly validation. Installed state began
reading from `assembly_state` instead of incorrectly treating unlocked parts as
installed.

### v0.5 — First Complete Mission Loop

**Purpose:** Prove that a player can start, observe, identify, learn and progress.

**Delivered:** New Game began with an unassembled telescope. The first Moon
mission could be selected in Sky Observation, identified in Telescope View,
recorded in the Learning Journal, rewarded with credits and followed by the next
level.

### v0.6 — Distinct Sky Observation Targets

**Purpose:** Make the sky feel like an astronomy scene rather than a button list.

**Delivered:** Moon, Polaris, Sirius, Betelgeuse, Mars, Jupiter, Orion Nebula
and Andromeda received distinct visual treatment. Transparent click regions kept
the starfield visible, while selection used a gold highlight rather than a large
opaque rectangle.

### v0.7 — Telescope View and Quality States

**Purpose:** Separate “what the player sees” from “what the player identifies.”

**Delivered:** A circular telescope field, target-specific images, Excellent/Good/
Fair/Poor/Failed quality states, and identification choices. Incorrect answers
could be rejected without completing the mission.

### v0.8 — Parts Cabinet and Assembly Separation

**Purpose:** Fix the information architecture so inventory and assembly do not
become one confusing screen.

**Delivered:** Parts Cabinet became an inventory/description screen while the
Assembly Table became the installation screen. Part mappings, return routes and
post-assembly guidance were clarified.

### v0.9 — Complete Observatory Background

**Purpose:** Stabilize the visual composition using a complete background image.

**Delivered:** The room used one coherent background with the player, transparent
interaction layer and HUD rendered above it. Interaction boxes were tightened
around the actual furniture and the player sprite gained separate display and
collision sizing with a stable foot anchor.

### v1.0 — Four-Direction Player Animation

**Purpose:** Fix wrong-facing sprites, frame bleeding, head remnants and foot
position drift.

**Delivered:** A clean 4-column by 4-row player sheet with down, left, right and
up rows; idle and walking frames; direction-aware animation; separate visual and
collision dimensions; and a shared bottom-foot anchor.

### v1.1 — Real Sky Position Pipeline

**Purpose:** Move the sky from invented fixed positions toward location-aware
observation.

**Delivered:** `SkyPositionService`, catalog data and observing configuration.
Solar-system targets could use AstronomyAPI when configured; stars and deep-sky
objects used RA/Dec calculations; offline/local fallback paths were retained.
Secrets were moved out of scripts and kept in ignored local configuration.

### v1.2 — Teaching Before Operation

**Purpose:** Put explanations before the player needs a new skill.

**Delivered:** `TeachingFlowManager`, Concept Briefs, one-time teaching steps,
separate “seen” and “completed” records, and operation-specific triggers for
assembly, observation, focus, identification and collimation.

### v1.3 — Focus Knob as a Real Part

**Purpose:** Make focus control depend on an installed component.

**Delivered:** Basic Focus Knob data, an assembly slot near the eyepiece,
`focus_control_score`, DMS coordinate feedback, and a clear gate when the part
was not installed.

### v1.4 — Readable Learning Card Diagrams

**Purpose:** Make the visual explanation large enough to teach from.

**Delivered:** Enlarged Concept Brief and Mission Complete diagram areas,
aspect-ratio-preserving TextureRect behavior and nearest-neighbour rendering for
optical paths, focal planes and observation concepts.

### v1.5 — Orion Nebula Focus and Quality Pass

**Purpose:** Prevent players from mistaking poor equipment quality for failed
focus.

**Delivered:** A more forgiving early Orion Nebula lesson, separate focus and
quality feedback, and clearer guidance for the difference between “focus is
wrong” and “the equipment/conditions are limiting the image.”

### v1.6 — Starlight Observatory Main Menu

**Purpose:** Replace the minimal menu with a recognizable product identity.

**Delivered:** A complete observatory-at-night main-menu background and
New Game, Continue, Settings, Language and Quit actions with pixel-realistic
brass/navy styling.

### v1.7 — Unified Eye / Finder / Scope Mode UI

**Purpose:** Make the three observation stages visually consistent.

**Delivered:** Shared mode-button artwork, transparent hit areas, active-state
framing and unavailable/inactive states that no longer compete visually.

### v1.8 — Jupiter Observation States

**Purpose:** Make observation quality visible instead of only numerical.

**Delivered:** Clear, blurry and dim Jupiter states, with quality results mapped
to the appropriate visual state and a large-image fallback for the Telescope View.

### v1.9 — Advanced Telescope Framework and Observation HUD

**Development period:** 2026-07-19.

**Purpose:** Integrate advanced assembly, optical feedback, environmental effects,
first-use guidance, target locking and a richer coordinate HUD.

**Delivered:**

- Newtonian and nested optical-tube assembly scaffolding.
- Newtonian collimation with an optical-axis result and threshold feedback.
- Refractor chromatic-aberration motivation and later reflector comparison.
- Real transparent installed-part textures with layer order:
  blueprint → installed art → completion border → OK marker → click region.
- Interaction feedback for hover, press, success, error, snapping and page entry.
- Focus, seeing, clouds, drift, tracking, finder calibration and target-lock
  feedback paths.
- Top azimuth and left altitude scales with DMS values.
- Eye, Finder and Scope reticle assets and shared target-derived lock radii.
- Identification feature guidance before the answer choices and randomized
  answer placement.
- Reduced-motion support so important state changes remain visible without large
  animation.

**Validation:** Observation UI acceptance, reticle regression, Newtonian parity,
modal-layer, coordinate-lock, animation-feedback, environmental-effect,
assembly-texture, story, teaching and full-flow suites were reported as passing.

### v2.0 — Web Delivery and Mobile Input

**Development period:** 2026-07-19 to 2026-07-20.

**Purpose:** Make the game playable through the public website and prepare a
mobile-style input path.

**Delivered:**

- Godot Web export through GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.
- Custom-domain delivery at `pixelobservatorygame.com` with Cloudflare in the
  delivery layer.
- Mobile Controller Mode with virtual joystick, interaction button, mission
  button, scope switching, focus controls and collimation controls.
- Touch-input abstraction that keeps the desktop keyboard path intact.
- Initial mobile observation gestures and touch-safe UI sizing.
- World-location, horizon, free-observation and detailed target-panel framework.

**Known follow-up:** Web deployment and mobile input still require real-device
testing across aspect ratios, and the world-map/horizon presentation needs more
cinematic polish and clearer first-use explanation.

## Dated Recent Updates

### 2026-07-04 — L10-L24 Teaching and Practice Structure

- Designed a spiral practice structure so one concept could be revisited across
  several missions with different conditions.
- Added chapter-level reasons for repeated targets, including focus,
  magnification, finder navigation, light gathering and tracking.
- Added teaching/story/mission-board data for the expanded early campaign.
- Recorded remaining gaps where data fields existed but mechanics still needed
  to be connected.

### 2026-07-05 — Observation Effects Specification

- Documented the intended relationship between focus, seeing, clouds, brightness,
  drift, magnification and tracking.
- Defined the difference between focus failure and insufficient observation
  quality so feedback would not blame the wrong mechanic.
- Identified the need for distinct clear, blurry and dim target artwork.

### 2026-07-10 to 2026-07-12 — Newtonian and Advanced Assembly Work

- Added reflector-family data and the nested optical-tube concept.
- Added main blueprint and tube blueprint workflows.
- Added primary mirror, mirror cell, secondary spider, secondary mirror,
  focuser, eyepiece and collimation-tool slots.
- Reused compatible tripod, mount and finder components outside the central tube
  assembly, matching the refractor information architecture.
- Added installed-art rendering, slot alignment checks and family-aware part
  filtering.

### 2026-07-18 — Observation HUD and Target Feedback

- Added or refined reticle assets for naked eye, finder and telescope views.
- Unified target projection, approach ring, lock ring, click region and actual
  completion radius.

- Added stronger visual feedback for collimation, tracking, cloud effects and
  target-centered state.

### 2026-07-19 — Web Publishing and Project Archive

- Archived the active project state and published the Web export workflow.
- Added Cloudflare/GitHub Pages deployment documentation and the public domain.
- Updated the English-first project overview and historical documentation.

### 2026-07-20 — Location, Horizon and Free Observation Systems

- Added the framework for observing-site selection when a target is below the
  horizon.
- Added world-map/location transition data and layered horizon scenery.
- Added free observation so non-mission celestial objects can be selected,
  inspected in a detailed scrollable panel and recorded without advancing the
  mission.
- Added online/local/offline data-source status so the origin of a coordinate is
  visible to the player.

### 2026-07-22 — Learning Diagram and Mobile Cabinet Update

- Replaced the `naked_eye_limits` teaching image with a larger light-gathering
  diagram showing pupil size, aperture, collected light and faint objects.
- Enlarged the Concept Brief image area while preserving its source ratio and
  nearest-neighbour pixel rendering.
- Added touch swipe scrolling to the Parts Cabinet.
- Added tap-versus-drag separation so a vertical swipe does not accidentally
  equip a part or open another screen.
- Preserved desktop mouse-wheel scrolling and normal click behavior.
- Added focused regression tests and capture checks for both changes.

## Current Known Gaps

These are intentionally listed so the log does not imply that every framework
feature is already a polished 1.0 feature:

- Some advanced telescope families still need final artwork, blueprint polish
  and family-specific interaction.
- Some later campaign content needs a diversity pass to avoid repeating the
  same target or concept card too many times.
- Below-horizon travel needs a stronger transition animation, clear world-map
  controls and more convincing parallax horizon layers.
- Mobile controls need real Android testing and a final APK release process.
- Some live astronomy data can fall back to local calculations or offline
  estimates when an external service is unavailable.

## Release Verification Policy

Before a release, run the relevant Godot headless tests, preserve/restore the
real save file, inspect 1024x768 and mobile captures, verify that no new UI text
mixes languages, and confirm that the Web export workflow completes. A source
commit is not itself a Web release until the export and deployment jobs finish.
